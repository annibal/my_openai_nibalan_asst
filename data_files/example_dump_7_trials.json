A sequential approach will be used in enrolling at least 100 pediatric participants, at least 20 of which will be aged ≥12 to \\<18 years and at least 80 participants will be aged ≥1 to \\<12 years. At the start of study B7841008, the dosing and data available in adolescent and adult participants in Study B7841005 supported the initiation of B7841008 study in participants aged ≥12 to \\<18 years. Subsequently, additional safety and efficacy data from adolescent participants in Study B7841005 became available for benefit/risk assessment in support of dosing participants aged ≥6 to \\<12 years. Based on the positive benefit/risk assessment conducted by both internal Pfizer review and eDMC review, dosing of the ≥6 to \\<12 years age group was initiated in June 2023 in B7841008 Study. Data from participants ≥6 years from B7841008 Study and Study B7841005 will support the dosing of participants aged ≥1 to \\<6 years.\n\nAll participants will be provided the prefilled pen (PFP) for administration of marstacimab in the study. Use of the prefilled syringe (PFS) will be permitted at the investigator's discretion for those participants who have difficulty with administration of the PFP. Additionally, participants will be provided the PFS for use in this study in countries where the PFS is anticipated to be the only presentation available commercially. An optional, open-label, single arm, substudy using the PFP was completed in the first 23 participants rolled over from Study B7841005 who agreed to participate in the substudy."

                  "detailedDescription": "The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy in improving fatigue and other outcomes such as sexual function, quality of life, body composition, muscle strength and physical activity in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in young cancer survivors who report fatigue and have testosterone deficiency.\n\nFatigue is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms in men with cancer affecting 70-100% of patients irrespective of their age. Cancer-related fatigue is experienced by patients not only during active cancer treatment, but is also highly prevalent in cancer survivors who exhibit persistent fatigue months to years after the end of their treatment with the highest prevalence being in recipients of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.\n\nIn addition to fatigue, sexual dysfunction is also highly prevalent in male cancer survivors. Male cancer survivors also have increased fat mass and decreased lean body mass, a phenotype that predisposes them to reduced muscle strength. This phenotype of fatigue, sexual dysfunction and adverse body composition is commonly encountered in non-cancer patient populations with testosterone deficiency, a condition which is also highly prevalent (50-90%) in cancer survivors. Pivotal trials of testosterone replacement therapy in non-cancer patient populations have shown an improvement in fatigue, sexual function and body composition in men randomized to testosterone compared with placebo. However, the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy on cancer-related fatigue has not been studied."

Safety will be assessed in all subjects and recovery will be assessed in two subjects receiving lower doses, either IM or SC, before additional men receive higher doses of IM or SC of DMAU. In addition to safety and tolerability, suppression of serum T, E2, gonadotropins, and SHBG will be assessed as secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. PK of DMAU and DMA will be assessed through blood draws done at each visit. Suppression of spermatogenesis will be assessed with semen analysis.\n\nDMAU injections will be administered at the study site by research nurses or physicians. For intramuscular injections, the staff will inject DMAU in castor oil into the gluteal region following standard procedures for intramuscular steroid injection. Abdominal subcutaneous injections will follow standard subcutaneous procedures. The subject will be observed for at least 30 minutes before release from the study site."

                  "detailedDescription": "Eligible patients are those who have progressive disease after treatment with Abi either in combination with ADT as initial therapy or as second-line therapy after development of resistance to primary ADT. Patients will continue on ADT with LHRH agonist (i.e. Zoladex, Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron) or LHRH antagonist (Degarelix) if not surgically castrated throughout the duration of the study to inhibit endogenous testosterone production. Patients will be randomized 1:2:2 and stratified based on whether they received Abi in combination with ADT or in sequence after progression on ADT and based on duration of response to Abi (\\<6 or ≥ 6 months).\n\nPatients randomized to Arm A will receive continuous therapy with standard dose Enza (160 mg po q day).\n\nPatients randomized to Arm B will receive Sequential Testosterone and Enzalutamide (STE). Patients in Arm B will receive intramuscular injection with testosterone cypionate (T) at a dose of 400 mg every 28 days x 2 (i.e. cycle 1). This dose was selected based on data demonstrating that it produces an initial high dose serum level of T (i.e. \\> 1500 ng/dL or 3-10 times normal level) with eugonadal levels achieved at the end of two weeks and near castrate levels after 28 days. On Day 1 of cycle 2, patients will stop testosterone and begin enzalutamide 160 mg po q day for 56 days. Each cycle is 56 days. On Day 1 of cycle 3, patient will not take enzalutamide and will again receive injection of testosterone. Patients will continue to alternate one cycle of testosterone (2 injections) with one cycle of 56 days of enzalutamide.\n\nPatients randomized to Arm C will receive Variable Sequential Testosterone and Enzalutamide (VSTE). Patients in Arm C will receive intramuscular injection with testosterone cypionate (T) at an FDA-approved dose of 400 mg every 28 days x 2 injections per cycle. Patients will remain on high dose T for at least one cycle. Each cycle is 56 days. Patients with PSA progression (≥25% increase in PSA from baseline PSA on BAT cycle) will stop T injection and begin Enzalutamide. Patients on T with initial with declining PSA decline PSA will remain on high dose T for additional cycles of 2 injections until PSA progression occurs (≥25% increase in PSA from PSA nadir on current BAT cycle)based on PCWG3 criteria. Patients with PSA progression (≥25% increase in PSA from baseline) will stop T injection. These patients will then be started on Enzalutamide. Patients with PSA progression (≥25% increase in PSA from baseline on enzalutamide cycle) will stop Enzalutamide and will restart injections of T with 2 injections/cycle. Patients on enzalutamide with initial PSA decline after one 56- day cycle will continue on Enzalutamide until PSA progression occurs (≥25% increase in PSA from PSA nadir on current Enzalutamide cycle). . Patients with PSA progression (≥25% increase in PSA from baseline) will stop Enzalutamide and will restart injections of T with 2 injections/cycle. These cycles of switching between T and Enza with onset of PSA progression will continue until clinical and/or radiographic progression occurs.\n\nPatients will have prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and symptoms assessment checked every cycle. Every 2 cycles (\\~4 months) patients will have repeat bone/CT scans to evaluate treatment response status. On CT scan, radiographic progression will be defined by RECIST criteria (i.e. \\>20% increase in the sum of target lesions). On bone scan, radiographic progression will be defined by PCWG3 criteria as ≥ 2 new bone lesions.\n\nPatients with PSA progression but with disease response or stable disease on imaging studies will remain on study until clinical or radiographic progression criteria are met. Patients with radiographic disease progression will stop treatment and come off study. Patients with clinical progression due to pain flare after first two injection of testosterone can remain on study. If pain persists after first cycle of enzalutamide, patients will stop treatment and come off study. If pain resolves on enzalutamide, but returns with next or subsequent cycles of testosterone, patients will stop treatment and come off study."

Evidence of dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit understanding or rendering of informed consent.\n* Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or solid organ transplant\n* History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated with curative intent with no known active disease ≥2 years before the first dose of study intervention and of low potential risk for recurrence. Exceptions include adequately resected non-melanoma skin cancer and curatively treated in situ disease.\n* Persistent toxicities (CTCAE Grade ≥2) caused by previous anticancer therapy, excluding alopecia. Patients with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by study intervention in the opinion of the investigator may be included (eg, hearing loss)\n* Known to have active hepatitis infection.\n* Known to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with a detectable viral RNA load or a CD4+ T-cell count \\< 350 cells/uL or a history of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infection within the past 12 months, or receiving anti-HIV medications for less than 4 weeks.\n* Known to have active tuberculosis infection (clinical evaluation that may include clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, or tuberculosis testing in line with local practice).\n* Treatment with any of the following:\n\n  i.
