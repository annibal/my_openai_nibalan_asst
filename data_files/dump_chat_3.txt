⮚ You: What part says i cant join because i smoked marihuana yesterday?
⋖ Assistant: The exclusion criteria that could disqualify you due to marijuana use is:

9. No known or suspected current alcohol dependence syndrome, chronic marijuana use, or any illicit drug use that may affect metabolism/transformation of steroid hormones and study treatment compliance.

⮚ You: it excludes me?
⋖ Assistant: It doesn't necessarily exclude you, but it does depend on the interpretation of:

“No known or suspected current alcohol dependence syndrome, chronic marijuana use, or any illicit drug use that may affect metabolism/transformation of steroid hormones and study treatment compliance.”

**Key Points:**
- **Current dependence**: Regular use that affects metabolism or compliance
- **Chronic use**: Regular, long-term use

If you only smoked marijuana once recently, it might not fall under “chronic use” or affect your eligibility. Confirm with the trial coordinator to be sure.

⮚ You: if i smoked marihuana i can't join?
⋖ Assistant: Would you please share if your marijuana use is a regular habit or just an isolated incident? This detail is crucial because the trial specifically excludes chronic use, which implies regular and long-term use.
⮚ You: only yesterday. i think the last time i used before that was last year
⋖ Assistant: Given that your marijuana use is not regular or chronic, you likely don't fall under the exclusion for "chronic marijuana use." You should be able to participate in the trial. However, I recommend confirming this with the trial coordinator to be sure.
⮚ You: which of the trials can i join?
⋖ Assistant: Based on your information—marijuana use being an isolated incident—you should be eligible for the following trials:

1. **Open-Label Extension Study of Marstacimab in Hemophilia Participants (NCT05145127)**
2. **Follitropin Delta vs Placebo for Male Idiopathic Infertility (NCT05403476)**
